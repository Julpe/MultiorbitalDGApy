box_sizes:
  niw_core: 100 # Number of bosonic frequencies used from G2(w,v,v'); default: -1 (all)

  niv_shell: 0 # Number of fermionic frequencies used for explicit asymptotics. If left at 0, no asymptotics are used. Default: 0

lattice:
  symmetries: "two_dimensional_square" # Specify lattice symmetry group. For availability, check out the file 'brillouin_zone.py'
  type: "from_wannier90" # Specifies the hopping elements, either from a wannier90 file 'from_wannier90', from a hk file 'from_wannierHK' or from tight-binding parameters 't_tp_tpp'
  hr_input: "/home/julpe/Documents/DATA/Singleorb-DATA/N085/wannier_hr.dat" # full path to the wannier_hr.dat/wannier.hk file or list of tight-binding parameters [t, tp, tpp] (only for single-orbital)
  interaction_type: "local_from_dmft" # Type of interaction. Available: ['local_from_dmft', 'kanamori_from_dmft', 'kanamori', 'custom'].
  # If 'local_from_dmft' or if interaction_type is left empty, we use the single-band interaction from DMFT. If 'kanamori_from_dmft', the interaction is parsed from the DMFT
  # calculation. If 'kanamori', we expect the interaction input to be a list containing the number of bands and two to three kanamori parameters, [n_bands, U, J, U'] (U' is optional; if left empty, U' is set to U-2J)
  # (U' is also sometimes called V). If 'custom', please specify the full path to a file in 'interaction_input' containing orbital and spacial entries for the interaction matrix
  # (similar to how a wannier_hr.dat file is structured, but with 4 orbital indices).
  interaction_input: [ 2, 2, 0.5 ] # full path to the interaction file or list of interaction parameters [n_bands, U, J, U'] (U' is optional; if left empty, U' is set to U-2J)
  # this parameter will only be used if interaction_type is either 'kanamori' or 'custom'
  nk: [ 16, 16, 1 ] # Number of k-points in x, y and z-direction. Default: [ 16, 16, 1 ]
  #nq: [ 16, 16, 1 ] # Number of q-points in x, y and z-direction. Default: [ 16, 16, 1 ]. If left empty, nq is set to nk

self_consistency:

  epsilon: 1e-4 # Convergence criterion of the self-energy for each frequency
  mixing: 0.2 # Mixing parameter for the self-energy. If set to 1, the self-energy is fully updated in each iteration. We use linear mixing,
  # i.e. the new self-energy is a linear combination of the old and the new one. sigma_new = mixing * sigma_new + (1 - mixing) * sigma_old
  use_poly_fit: False # If True, the code will use the polynomial fit of the self-energy for the next iteration with the settings specified below. Will
  # not work if do_poly_fitting below is not set to True
