moLDGA is a Python toolbox for performing the multi-orbital (self-consistent) Dynamical Vertex Approximation and Eliashberg
equation for strongly correlated electron systems. It is based on [DGApy](https://github.com/PaulWorm/DGApy), which is the one-band version of it, written by Paul Worm.

For details on how the code works, how to use it and its configuration, please refer to my [Master's thesis](https://github.com/Julpe/MasterThesis/blob/main/main.pdf). If you use this code, please consider citing it and also consider citing my thesis.
