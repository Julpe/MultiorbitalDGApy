MultiorbitalDGApy is a Python toolbox for performing the multiorbital Dynamical Vertex Approximation and Eliashberg
equation for strongly
correlated electron systems. It is based on [DGApy](https://github.com/PaulWorm/DGApy), which is the one-band version of
it, written by Paul Worm.

For details on how the code works, how to use it and its configuration, please refer to my Master's thesis.
